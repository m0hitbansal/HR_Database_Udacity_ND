# HR_Database_Udacity_ND

In this project, I have designed, built, and populated a database for the Human Resources (HR) Department at the imaginary Tech ABC Corp, a video game company. This project will start with a request from the HR Manager. From there, I had to design a database using the foundational principals of data architecture that is best suited to the department's needs. This project is important, as it is a scaled-down simulation of the kind of real-world assignments data architects work on every day.
